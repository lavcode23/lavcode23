👋 Hi, I’m Lavisha Yadav

🎓 M.Tech (AI & Data Science)
📍 India
💡 Passionate about building applied AI systems, not just models
🚀 Focused on Machine Learning, Automation & AI-driven Products

🧠 About Me

I’m an AI & Data Science graduate who enjoys turning real-world problems into deployable machine learning solutions.
I believe AI should be usable, explainable, and impactful, not just theoretical.

I have hands-on experience building and deploying ML applications including:

End-to-end ML pipelines

Intelligent recommendation systems

Fraud detection systems

NLP-based classifiers

Face & emotion-aware AI applications

All my projects are implemented, deployed, and documented, not just notebooks.
